This project assigns barcodes to a dataset of 100 images from the MNIST database. 

Using threshold projections and the Hamming distance algorithims, it compares barcodes to find visually similar images within the dataset. 

Instructions: Look for desired barcode in 'filesandbarcode.csv', and input into 'barcode.py'
